## Purpose
This application is a timed quiz app designed to test the User on their knowledge of Javascript fundamentals. The User has 75 seconds to answer as many questions as possible. If the User answers a question incorrectly, they will lose 10 seconds off the clock. At the end of the 75 seconds, or when the User has finished the quiz, they will be given a score and prompted to enter their innitials. The application will store these values in local storage. At any point in the quiz, the User can access the high score list. The user can also clear the scores in local storage and play the quiz over.
